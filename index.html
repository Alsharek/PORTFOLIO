          <h4>COO</h4>
          The small book store opened its doors on 25/Feb/2018. Being a book lover, and having supportive friends, there was an idea to open the store to sell English books, as they were sometimes hard to find in Iraq, and a lot of people were asking for it. , In charge of the front desk of the store, I built good communication with people so we could get the books we needed from outside of Iraq, when we decided to open up in Zayoona mall in Baghdad, my friends organized the process of buying books from outside of Iraq. When I moved to Belgium, I left the business.
